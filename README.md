To address problems in graph geometry or graph theory applied to the field of sound/audio, a basic understanding of the following concepts is necessary:

Graph theory: This includes knowledge of basic graph concepts such as vertices, edges, paths, cycles, and connectivity, as well as more advanced concepts such as graph coloring, matching, and planarity.

Discrete mathematics: This includes knowledge of basic concepts such as combinatorics, set theory, and logic, which are often used in graph theory.

Linear algebra: This includes knowledge of basic concepts such as vectors, matrices, and eigenvalues, which are often used in graph theory and geometric algorithms.

Signal processing: This includes knowledge of basic concepts such as sampling, filtering, and Fourier analysis, which are used to analyze and manipulate sound and audio signals.

Algorithm design and analysis: This includes knowledge of basic concepts such as time and space complexity, as well as experience implementing and analyzing algorithms.

Programming: This includes knowledge of programming languages such as Python, Matlab, C++ or Java and experience implementing and experimenting with algorithms.

Music theory or audio engineering: This includes knowledge of basic concepts such as music notation, harmony, melody, rhythm, timbre, and sound synthesis.

It's also important to note that the field is interdisciplinary, so depending on the specific problem you are trying to solve, you may also need knowledge from other fields like computer science, physics, and statistics.
